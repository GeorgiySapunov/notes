## File with explicitly installed packages

    var/lib/portage/world

## dispatch-conf

dispatch-conf is a tool that aids in merging the ._cfg0000_<name> files.
._cfg0000_<name> files are generated by Portage when it wants to overwrite a
file in a directory protected by the CONFIG_PROTECT variable.

With dispatch-conf, users are able to merge updates to their configuration
files while keeping track of all changes.

    sudo dispatch-conf
